<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project spring boot restful APIs using OAS 3 (spring-doc), Docker with openjdk:alpine, and oAuth2

This API stores data to a MySql database using JPA and JDBC.  The data includes HOA details (name, address, year built) and the financial details (reserve components, fees charged, etc).  We utilize this data to compare to other HOAs proving owners, board volunteers, and property managers with transparency into areas they can improve their operations.

We are open source. Our goal is to improve the lives of homeowners.  If you have an awesome idea for a feature, please fork the repo and create a pull request or simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

Here is a screenshot of our API:
